# Falcon 40B Chatbot in Hugging Face and LangChain 🦅🤖

Welcome to the Falcon 40B Chatbot Demo repository! This project demonstrates how to utilize the Falcon-40B-Instruct model from Hugging Face in combination with the LangChain framework. The code showcases how to set up and interact with the model, while also integrating it into the LangChain library for advanced conversational capabilities.

## 📜 Overview

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook (`falcon-40b-chatbot.ipynb`) that illustrates how to:

- Install the required libraries for model setup and interaction
- Initialize the Hugging Face pipeline for text generation
- Integrate the pipeline with the LangChain framework
- Set up a conversational agent using Falcon 40B
- Implement output parsing to clean up generated text
